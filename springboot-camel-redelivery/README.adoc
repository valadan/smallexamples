# Spring Boot :: Apache Camel Redelivery

This example shows how Apache Camel handles redeliveries: _redelivery starts from the point of failure_.

## Worth noticing
The integration test in `HelloWorldRedeliveryRouteBuilderIntegrationTests` documents this behavior.

Take a look at the camel route `HelloWorldRedeliveryRouteBuilder` and how it uses the
collaborating Spring bean `CamelFriend`.
